"Hi, my name is hello12324 and I'm a software developer (not exactly).
I have two projects on GitHub called MyProjects and smb_bulescreen_attack.
The mb_bulescreen_attack project is a tool for automated SMB protocol exploits (creator is Radu-Emanuel Chiscariu,
I just added the automatic function to the code optimization), MyProjects project is a project of my own, which contains many applications of my distributed projects. For example, the project PassworldCrack is written in rust language. It does not require a dictionary and only needs a small number of strings. code cracking items,
It is almost finished now, but it needs to be rewritten. It may be that there is a problem with my writing and the efficiency is relatively low, so I am going to rewrite it in C language.

There are other projects of mine in it, please take a look and don't leave!.
If you have some suggestions, please discuss with me at testsendkfotesycike@gmail.com

I hope to be able to share my skills and experience with you through these projects, and to learn and progress together with you. "
